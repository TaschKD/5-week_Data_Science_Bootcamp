**What to do next?**

* **Run each line of code** and understand - read the comments/description and understand what the code does. Also, do the exercises that are there in between!
* **You DON’T need to memorize this code.** But you must try and understand how it works, and you must learn to use it at various places based on the requirement
* **Still not understanding?** Don’t worry; we will get used to it over time. Drop us a message on the help channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/E2XfSEYm2W), and we will help you.
* **Session is overwhelming?** - Yes, it could be. When we are doing something new, there will be friction, so please take it easy and watch the last 5 mins of the session below. With time things will be fine :)

Go through the last 5 mins of the session once again!
