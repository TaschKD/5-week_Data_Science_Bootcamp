**What to do next?**

* **Run each line of code** and understand - read the comments/description that is written and understand what the code does. Also, do the exercises that are there in between!
* **You DON’T need to memorize this code.** But you must try and understand how it works and you must learn to use it at various places based on the requirement
* **Still not understanding?** Don’t worry, we will get used all of it overtime. Drop us a message on #help channel on Slack, we will help you or you can get in touch with your personal assigned coaches.
* **Session is overwhelming?** - Yes, it could be. When we are doing something new there will be a friction, so please take it easy and watch the last 5 mins of the session in next slide. With time things will be fine

Go through the last 5 mins of the session once again!
