## Learning Objectives

* Conditional Statement
* Dictionary

## Conditional Statement: if-else-elif

* In the real world, we commonly evaluate information around us and then choose one course of action or another based on what we observe:  
If the weather is nice, then I'll go for a walk. (It's implied that I won't go for a walk if the weather isn't nice.)
* In a Python program, the if statement is how you perform this decision-making. It allows for the conditional execution of a statement or group of statements based on the value of an expression.

### If
* Syntax (how to write If statement in Python?) -  
```
if test expression/condition:
   statement(s)
```
* Here, the program evaluates the test expression and will execute statement(s) only if the test expression is True.
* If the test expression is False, the statement(s) is not executed.
* In Python, the body of the if statement is indicated by the indentation. The body starts with an indentation, and the first unindented line marks the end.
* Python interprets non-zero values as True (even negative values). None and 0 are interpreted as False.
* Let's understand this with a few examples:

* Example: Python program to detect if a number is even. (sign % tells us the remainder of an expression. Any number with a remainder of 0 after dividing by 2 must be even.)

### If-else
* Syntax -  
```
if test expression:
   Body of if 
else:
   Body of else
```
* The if-else statement evaluates test expression and will execute the body of if only when the test condition is True.
* If the condition is False, the body of else is executed. Indentation is used to separate the blocks.

### If-elif-else
* Syntax -
```
if test expression:
   Body of if
elif test expression:
   Body of elif
else:
   Body of else
```
* The elif is short for else if. It allows us to check for multiple expressions.
* If the condition for if is False, it checks the condition of the next elif block and so on.
* If all the conditions are False, the body of else is executed.
* Only one block among the several if-elif-else blocks is executed according to the condition.
* The if block can have only one else block. But it can have multiple elif blocks.
* Flowchart:

* Now, let's try to understand the above example.
  * We first assigned the value 5 to x
  * The control shifts to the following line where x%2 is checked. 5 is not divisible by 2, so the control doesn't shift to the body of if.
  * Then, the elif statement: x%3 is executed. Since 5 is not divisible by 3, the body of elif is not executed.
  * Finally, the else statement is executed, and the control shifts to the body of the else statement. The print statement ("z is neither divisible by 2 nor by 3" is executed.
* Point to be noted: The conditions are checked in a top to bottom order. If any of the above if or elif condition is True, it'll be executed, and no other conditions will be checked.
* Can you figure out what z=6 will print in the given example?

## Dictionary

* Dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs.
* Real word dictionaries are a good analogy to understand them: they contain a list of items(words), and each item has a key(the word) and a value(the word's meaning).
* It generally is used when we have a massive amount of data.
* It is defined within braces, with each item in the form of key: value pairs. Syntax â€“  
```
my_dict = {
key1:value1,
key2:value2,
}
```

### Dictionary

* The keys in a dictionary must always be unique and immutable. This is the reason dictionary keys can be String but not List.
* On the other hand, Values in a dictionary can be of any datatype and can be duplicated
* Dictionary keys are case sensitive; same name but different cases of Key will be treated distinctly.
* Example:

### Looping over Dictionary

* Let's say we have a dictionary containing countries as keys and their populations as values.

* For looping through a dictionary, we use a method called items( ). Like enumerate, it gives us both the keys and values of a dictionary.

### Let's Practice

1. Take values of length and breadth of a rectangle from the user and check if it is a square.
1. Take two int values from the user and print the greatest among them.
1. Write a program to read a candidate's age and determine whether they are eligible to cast their vote.
1. Write a Python program to add a key to a dictionary.  
Sample Dictionary : {0: 10, 1: 20}  
Expected Result : {0: 10, 1: 20, 2: 30}
1. Below are two lists; convert them into a dictionary. keys = \['Ten', 'Twenty', 'Thirty']  
values = \[10, 20, 30]  
Expected output:  
{'Ten': 10, 'Twenty': 20, 'Thirty': 30}
1. Access the value of key 'history'  
```
sampleDict = {
"class":{
"student":{
"name":"Mike",
"marks":{
"physics":70,
"history":80
}
}
}
}
```  
Expected output:  
80
7. Given the following dictionary:  
inventory = {  
'gold' : 500,  
'pouch' : \['flint', 'twine', 'gemstone'],  
'backpack' : \['xylophone','dagger', 'bedroll','bread loaf']  
}  
Try to do the following:
   * Add a key to inventory called 'pocket'.
   * Set the value of 'pocket' to be a list consisting of the strings' seashell', 'strange berry', and 'lint'.
   * .sort()the items in the list stored under the 'backpack' key.
   * Then .remove('dagger') from the list of items stored under the 'backpack' key.
   * Add 50 to the number stored under the 'gold' key.
