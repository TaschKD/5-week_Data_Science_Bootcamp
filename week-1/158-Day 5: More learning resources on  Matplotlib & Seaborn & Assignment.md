## Learning Resources

Hello Learners,

Here are some more interesting learners resources that you can refer to learn more about data visualization libraries.

* [Introduction to Data Visualization](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-data-visualization-in-python-89a54c97fbed) (you may consider opening in incognito window if it is asking for premium upgrade).
* Seaborn library official [introduction](https://seaborn.pydata.org/introduction.html) and [tutorials](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html).
* Matplotlib library [official tutorials](https://matplotlib.org/3.2.1/tutorials/index.html).

Note: As mentioned, there is no need to memorize code, you can simply follow the tutorials, get the code snippets and apply it in any context. Get to learn how to read the code and understand what every line of code is doing!

## Real-world implementation of Visualization

You must look at this real-life implementation of putting data science skills into practice. Thanks @Pascal Wiltschko (Coach) for coming up with this. This was made to create learners progress report among his group of learners, you can also access the colab notebook in next slide.

## Pascal’s Visualization Notebook

Dataset: The data is learners data for quizzes on DPhi Learning Platform. So it is a real dataset :)

* Link to the Dataset:  
[DPhi Learner Groups Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dphi-official/Datasets/master/DPhi%20-%20Learners%20-%20Beginners%20%26%20Absolute%20Beginners%20-%20Real%20Dataset%20-%20DPhi_Learners.csv)
* His original notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/dphi-official/Data\_Science\_Bootcamp/blob/master/Advanced\_Material/Leaderboard\_Plots/Leader\_board\_plots\_original.ipynb)**.**

Note: Just learn by understanding the code and if possible play careful and don’t get overwhelmed, we will learn more about with the dataset. Caution: There are a lot of null values so be treating missing values soon!
